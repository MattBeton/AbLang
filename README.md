# Code for training AbLang

This code can be used for training AbLang based on ESM-2's architecture


# Set-up environment

In an environment with a python version of at least 3.8 and while in the main folder with the setup.py file, run the following command.


`
pip install .
`

This installs all the requirements needed to run the training code.

# Start training

In the [notebook folder](https://github.com/TobiasHeOl/ablang-train/blob/main/notebooks/explore-training.ipynb) there is a guide for how to run the pieces of code separately, while the run_training.py in the ablang_train folder is a single script for training.

# Data

An example of the input data is seen in the data folder. The naming of the folders and files within the 'single_data' folder are currently hard-coded.
